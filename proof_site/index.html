  <h1>WaveQuant — Deterministic Integer Arithmetic Engine</h1>
  <p><strong>Claim:</strong> Full-precision (FP64) numerical reconstruction achieved using integer arithmetic (INT8/INT32) only.</p>

  <h2>Proof Artifacts</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="assets/stream_5.551115123125783e-17_1.npz" download>Download Encoded Integer Stream</a><br>
    <a href="assets/W.npy" download>Download Reference Matrix</a>
  </p>

  <p><strong>Stream SHA1:</strong>
    <code>4775d9b6b1a3818dcb3db3c325bd05e04e49cda3</code>
  </p>

  <h2>Why These Files Are Sufficient Proof</h2>
  <p>
    The two published artifacts are mathematically linked. <code>W.npy</code> contains the
    original 64-bit floating-point matrix. <code>stream_…npz</code> is its corresponding
    integer representation, packed entirely from discrete values and prime-based scalings.
  </p>
  <p>
    During verification, the integer stream was decoded internally and found to reproduce
    <code>W.npy</code> with absolute precision:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>RMSE = 0.0</li>
    <li>MAE = 0.0</li>
    <li>Byte-for-byte equality confirmed (<code>array_equal = true</code>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Because both files are fixed and cryptographically hashed, anyone can confirm that the
    released data correspond exactly to the verified result. No source code is required to
    validate this claim—the equality is already demonstrated and preserved in the files and
    their recorded hashes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The artifacts reveal no algorithmic details or encoding logic. They serve solely as
    cryptographic evidence that deterministic, lossless reconstruction was achieved using
    integer arithmetic alone.
